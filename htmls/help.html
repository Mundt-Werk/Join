                        <span>Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built 
                        by a group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp 
                        at the Developer Akademie. 
                        <br><br>
                        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", 
                        is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress,  
                        and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span>Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban 
                        to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
                        <br><br>

                                When you log in to <span>Join</span>, you'll find a default board. 
                                This board represents your project 
                                and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In 
                                Progress", "Await feedback" and "Done".

                                can start adding cards. Cards represent 
                                individual tasks. Click the "+" button under 
                                the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill 
                                in the task details in the card, like task

                                by dragging and dropping the card from one

                                Once a task is completed, you can either 
                                move it to the "Done" list or delete it. 
                                Deleting a card will permanently remove it 
                                from the board. Please exercise caution 
                                when deleting cards, as this action is 
                                irreversible.
